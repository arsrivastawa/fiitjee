                  The Beginning
                </h1>
                FIITJEE was created in 1992 by the vision and toil of{" "}
                <span className="font-bold text-lg"> Mr. D. K. Goel,</span> a
                Mechanical Engineering Graduate from{" "}
                <span className="font-bold ">IIT Delhi.</span> We had a very
                humble beginning as a forum for IIT-JEE, with a vision to
                provide an ideal launch pad for serious JEE aspirants.Along the
                way to realization of this vision, we went beyond merely
                coaching for IIT-JEE. We actually started to make a difference
                in the way Students think and approach problems. We started to
                develop ways to enhance Studentsâ€™ IQ. We started to leave an
                indelible mark on the Students who have undergone FIITJEE
                training.We started changing lives. And all this was not a sheer
                coincidence. It was the urge, the compelling desire, to always
                aspire for perfection and in the process,continuously keep on
                setting newer benchmarks of excellence, which enabled us and our
                Students to achieve what we have achieved.

                  Our Success
                </h1>
                The Success of our Students was inspiring and so was their faith
                in FIITJEE. It was this faith that was a catalyst for our
                venturing into areas beyond IIT-JEE.It was this faith that
                prompted us to embark on a mission to provide Wholesome School
                Education to Students through FIITJEE Integrated School Programs
                like UDAYA Plus,SUPREME&PINNACLE, in a way so that there was no
                need for any type of coaching outside of the School System. In
                addition to the launch of FIITJEE Junior Colleges in
                Bhubaneswar,Hyderabad, Vijayawada & Visakhapatnam many
                like-minded Schools across the Country joined hands with us in
                this Student centric endeavor to create Ideal School Education
                platform for Students to get admission in IITs & US Universities
                without stress & tension along with huge success in Olympiads,
                SAT-I & SAT-II. And it was this faith only that again enabled us
                to create landmark success in NTSE.
